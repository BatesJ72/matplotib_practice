# matplotib_practice
This is a homework assignment for the UT BootCamp that focuses on data cleaning and visualization with Matplotlib and Pandas.

At the top of the notebook are three observations/inferences I drew from analyzing the data. 

First, I joined two data sets together and cleaned the data (focusing on removing duplicates). Then, I used summary statistics to get a clearer picture of what the data contains. 

After the data was clean and I had an idea of the contents, I created several visualizations to ensure the main points of the data will be clear to the end user, like the fact that the numbers of mice are evenly distributed by gender and amongst the drug regimes, indicating that the outcomes of the study are trustworthy. There is also a box and whisker plot that clearly shows which two drugs are the frontrunners in terms of effectiveness at shrinking tumor size, as well as indicating where outliers are. Finally, I created a series of charts detailing information from one of the most effective drugs in order to give the end user a clear indication of its effects.
